## Usage ##

There are 3 different sorts of control (hardest first).

  * Halo - A halo is a panel which can be used to manage nested rings or bands of controls, such as the hour and minute sliders on a time picker or clock

  * HaloRing / HaloChain - A ring can be used to position items around a circle; a chain is a specialised ring used to display circular text

  * HaloArc / HaloSlice - An arc is a circular path, like a slice of doughnut; a slice is a filled arc, like a slice of pie

Finally, the Slider control is designed for use in a HaloRing.
